  <h1>Welcome</h1>
           <p>NuTyX is a complete GNU/Linux distribution targeting performance and flexibility, it is based on the Linux From Scratch books <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/">LFS</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/">BLFS</a>. We recommend to have some knowledge about the GNU/Linux system. NuTyX is an excellent operating system for a person who want to invest himself as well develop his/her skills and finally knowing what he/she is doing. The maintainer is french mother language but understand and speak english as well. NuTyX is a binary distribution  optimise for the archs i686 and x86_64 . Up to you to use the ports system and install your own packages from sources, they will be natively integrated to the system.</p>
           <h2>The 10 advantages of NuTyX</h2>
	    <ol>
		<li>The ability to be installed from almost any other distribution, tanks to the BASH script which can be download, check and then launch from the host distribution.</li>
		<li>The maintenance system which allow to make a lot of manipulation in case you have a major failure system. The maintenance system is also able to erase, modify as the file system is not mounted. It can then also partition, format, reinstall and installthe boot process ( grub )  back.</li>
		<li>The syntax of a rezept of a package is probably the most simple we can find. Very close to the one used by the CRUX distribution, in most of the cases, it can be writen  in less then 10 lines. Dependencies (if we want) can be handle as well. Personnal packages will be also handle by the binary package manager.</li>
		<li>Once installed, it's very easy to produce a live version of his NuTyX. The live produced can be re install on other machines. We can find many versions of live NuTyX on <a class="url" href="http://www.freetorrent.fr">the website of freetorrent.fr</a></li>
                <li>A binary package is made of several "parts, one "base" need for the normal operation of the operating system and a few sub packages like for exemple: devel, man, doc and lib.</li>
                <li>The need of a separate disk or partition is obsolete since the installer is able to (re)install NuTyX without having to format the target disk or partition because ...</li>
                <li>The installer will NEVER FORMAT on his own a target partition for the installation of NuTyX. It means that NuTyX can be installed on a partition containing (for exemple) personnal datas, various folders (as long thoses folders does not belong to the system).</li>
                <li>A simple command give the possibility to return to a base system and give the possibility for exemple to change completly his Windows graphical interface (for ex. from KDE to XFCE) without having to reinstall and without to download every packages again, the allready download packages and uptodate will be simply reinstalled.</li>
                <li>The package manager is totally unique and rewrite specialy for the needs of NuTyX. It's made of consistants and expandibles modules. No dependencies (beside glibc) are need. One of its strong point is most probably the ability to discover automatically the binaries dependencies.</li>
                <li>All the packages are properly compiled per level on a dedicated compiler server. After compilation, all the dependencies are again checked to make shure no broken links are found.</li>
               </ol>
	  <p>NuTyX offer the KDE and XFCE graphical interfaces in binaries.
