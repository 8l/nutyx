The D-Bus GLib package contains GLib interfaces to the D-Bus API.
Since version 2.26, GLib includes a D-Bus binding.
This is intended to replace the DBus-GLib bindings and 
many applications have started migrating their code.
See the documentation for the high-level and low-level API for more details.
