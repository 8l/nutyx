Used to describe the program APIs and collect them in a uniform, machine readable format.
GObject introspection is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject) and 
language bindings. The C library can be scanned at compile time and generate 
a metadata file, in addition to the actual native C library. 
Then at runtime, language bindings can read this metadata and automatically 
provide bindings to call into the C library.
