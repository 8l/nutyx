Implementation of xmp (Adobe's Extensible Metadata Platform)
Exempi is an implementation of XMP. Version 2.x is based on Adobe XMP SDK 
and released under a BSD-style license like Adobe's. The 3 clause BSD (aka New-BSD) 
license is compatible with GPL. 
The licensing is kept identical in order to allow two-way merging 
of the code (ie sending our change to the XMP SDK to Adobe for integration).
