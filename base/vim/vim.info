The Vim package contains a powerful text editor.

Vim is an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power
of the de-facto Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set.
It's useful whether you're already using vi or using a different editor. 

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.
It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.

Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming
that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though.
Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email
to editing configuration files.
