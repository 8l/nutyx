The Ntfs-3g package contains a stable, read-write open source driver for NTFS partitions.
NTFS partitions are used by newer Microsoft operating systems.
Ntfs-3g enables you to mount NTFS partitions in read-write mode
from your Linux system. It uses the FUSE kernel module to be able
to implement NTFS support in user space.

This package contains both the NTFS-3g driver itself and
various utilities useful for manipulating NTFS partitions.
