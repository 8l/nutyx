The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions.
This allows a programmer to call any function specified by a call interface description at run time. 
These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate compilation to work. 
One such convention is the "calling convention". The "calling convention" is a set of assumptions made 
by the compiler about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function. 
A "calling convention" also specifies where the return value for a function is found.
