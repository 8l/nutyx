Gperf generates a perfect hash function from a key set.
GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. 
For a given list of strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, 
in form of C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the input string.
The hash function is perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions,
and the hash table lookup needs a single string comparison only.
