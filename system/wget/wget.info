The Wget package contains a useful utility for non-interactive download of files.

GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using
HTTP, HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. 
It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be
called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without 
X-Windows support, etc.
