The Perl package contains the Practical Extraction and Report Language.
Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, 
extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information. 
It quickly became a good language for many system management tasks. 
Over the years, Perl has grown into a general-purpose programming language. 
It's widely used for everything from quick "one-liners" to full-scale application development.
